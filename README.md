# Grind LeetCode Journey

LeetCode progress documentation

### April 6 2024:

As of today, I will be doing 56 LeetCode questions for the next 3 weeks. The files week-1, week-2, and week-3, will be contain my submissions to LeetCode in order of attempts as well as my documentation on how I implemented the solution for the next 3 weeks. After the end of April, I will be categorizing the tasks by LeetCode difficulty instead of attempted time of week.
