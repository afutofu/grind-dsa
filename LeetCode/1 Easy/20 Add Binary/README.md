# Add Binary

Use: Binary addition

- Understand how binary addition work in that the only two digits it can hold is 0 and 1
- Pad out the shorter string with 0s infront
- Iterate from the back of the strings and do addition using carry digits and work until the end of the list
- If there is a carry when the loop ends, append a 1 in front of the string
